            <p class="info" id="general" > People have been breeding dogs since prehistoric times.
                The earliest domesticated dogs were bred from wolves.
                These dogs were trained for hunting, herding and guarding.
            </p>

            <p class="info" > At first people trained dogs exclusively for pragmatic purposes, but as people got more sophisticated,
                so did their dogs. As time went on specific breeds of dogs emerged, each with their own specialized purpose and appearance.
                <span id="question" >But what seperates one breed from another?</span> <br>
                The best way to define a breed is to say it <span id="quotes" >"breeds true"</span>, meaning that you breed two dogs of the same breed, you will get
                an instantly recognizable dog of that same breed.
            </p>
